# DSA
🚀 **This repository contains my complete journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms using _Python_.**

## Overview
This repo contains my implementations, notes, and practice problems as I learn Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.

## Current structure
- `Array/` — implementations related to arrays (e.g., `DynamicArray.py`)

## How to use
- Explore the code, run or extend the examples, and add your own notes or tests.
- **Recommended:** Python 3.8+.

*Progress log:* Working through topics folder-by-folder; more content will be added as I practice and solve problems.
