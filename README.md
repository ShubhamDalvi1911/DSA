# DSA 🚀

**A collection of Data Structures & Algorithms implementations and practice problems in Python.**

## Overview
This repository contains implementations, notes, and solved problems organized by topic. It's intended for learning, reference, and small experiments.

## Features
- Implementations in plain Python (no external dependencies)
- Short example usage for each module
- Exercises & notes (work in progress)

## Project structure
- `Array/` — array implementations and examples (e.g., `DynamicArray.py`)
- (Add more folders as you implement them)

## Topics covered
- **Array** — Dynamic array implementation (`Array/DynamicArray.py`) ✅ **Covered**

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+

## Usage
Run an example file directly:

```bash
python Array/DynamicArray.py
```

Or import and use the implementation from your scripts:

```python
from Array.DynamicArray import MereList

lst = MereList()
lst.append("Alice")
lst.append(42)
print(lst, len(lst))
```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome — open an issue or a pull request. Please keep changes small and include tests or examples when possible.
